            <b>What is Sanskrit?</b>
            <br />
            Sanskrit is one of the most ancient languages in the world! It is believed to have been created before 1500 BCE (before the Common Era). The Vedas were the first known texts written in Sanskrit, containing holy poems, songs, and rituals. Later, between the 4th century BCE and the 4th century CE, sacred Indian texts such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana were written in Sanskrit. However, over time, the use of Sanskrit declined and eventually faded away.

            However, learning Sanskrit might initially seem tedious. That is why I have created this websiteâ€”to help you break down complex languages into simpler pieces.
            <br />
            <br />
            You will find five tabs titled <i>Info, Vowels, Consonants, Guess The Letter, and Guess The Audio.</i> The first section is the one you are currently reading. The second and third tabs will allow you to learn the Sanskrit alphabet, starting with the vowels and then the consonants. Simply click on a letter and then click the big letter to hear its pronunciation.
            <br />
            <br />
            The fourth and fifth sections help you practice the Sanskrit alphabet. In the fourth section, an audio will be provided, and you will have to guess the corresponding letter. However, in the fifth section, you will do the opposite, you will have to find the audio that matches the given letter.
